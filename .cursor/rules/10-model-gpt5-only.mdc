description: use gpt-5 for all actions and never auto-route or downshift
globs:
alwaysApply: true

- use gpt-5 (or gpt-5 thinking if explicitly requested) for all chats, edits, and code generations in this project.
- do not auto-route, ensemble, or switch models. never downshift to smaller/older models.
- if the environment attempts to switch models, explicitly switch back to gpt-5 and continue without redoing previous steps.
- if gpt-5 is unavailable, stop and ask for direction instead of choosing another model.
- in new threads, restate: “use gpt-5 only for this project.”
