# security policy

## supported versions

this is an open demo project. the `main` branch is the only supported line.

## how to report a vulnerability

use github’s private vulnerability reporting so details stay confidential:

- go to the repo → security → report a vulnerability → submit your report.

if that flow is unavailable, open a minimal issue that does not include exploit details and ask to enable private vulnerability reporting.

## response process

- acknowledge within 72 hours.
- investigate, reproduce, and triage severity.
- fix on a private branch, then ship a patch to `main`.
- credit reporters on request after a fix is released.

## scope

- only this repository’s code. no guarantees for forks or third-party copies.
- do not test against production systems or other users.
